ðŸ“Œ Project Description â€“ Car Detection using YOLO

This project focuses on detecting cars in visual data using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. YOLO is known for its real-time performance and accuracy, making it ideal for applications like traffic monitoring, smart parking systems, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance.

The main goal is to identify and locate cars in images, videos, or live webcam streams by drawing bounding boxes around them and displaying confidence scores. The detection is powered by a pre-trained YOLOv5 model, which can be further fine-tuned on a custom dataset if needed for more accurate results in specific environments.

Key Features:

* Fast and real-time car detection with YOLOv5
* Support for various input types: image, video, and webcam
* Easy integration and modification for other vehicle types
* Output includes bounding boxes and confidence labels
* Optional custom training support for improved results

This project provides a foundational setup for anyone looking to build computer vision systems related to vehicle detection using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
